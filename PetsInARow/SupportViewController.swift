    let HELP_TEXT = "3 In A Row! is a version of the classic tic-tac-toe board game. It is played by two opponents (player and computer), who take turns marking the squares on the game board, a 3 x 3 grid. The object of the game is to place three successive marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row on the grid. The opponents alternate moves, with the player touching the desired square in the grid to place a mark, followed by the computer marking a square.  The opponent who first obtains three-in-a-row wins; if neither opponent is able to obtain three-in-a-row and all moves are exhausted the game is declared a draw.\n\nGame Play\nAt startup 3 In A Row! displays the game board on the playing screen. If the player is configured to make the first move, he touches the desired square on the board to place a mark in the square. The computer then responds by marking one of the board squares.

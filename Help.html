    <h2>About</h2>
    <b>Pets In A Row</b> is a version of the classic tic-tac-toe board game. It is played by
    two opponents (player and computer), who take turns marking the squares on a game board.
    The object of the game is to place three successive marks in a
    horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row on the grid. The opponents alternate moves,
    with the player touching the desired square in the grid to place a mark, followed
    by the computer marking a square.  The opponent who first obtains three-in-a-row
    wins; if neither opponent is able to obtain three-in-a-row and all moves are
    exhausted the game is declared a draw.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <h2>Game Play</h2>
    At startup <b>Pets In A Row</b> displays the game board on the playing screen. If the player
    is configured to make the first move, he touches the desired square on the board to
    place a mark in the square. The computer then responds by marking one of the board
    squares. (Note that if the computer is configured to make the first move it marks
    one of the board squares when the <i>New Game</i> button is selected).
    <br/>
    At the conclusion of a game the playing screen displays the outcome (win, loss, or draw). A
    new game will automatically start shortly after the outcome is displayed.  You can also
    quit a game in progress or start a new game by touching the <i>New Game</i> button.
    <br/>
    To view/update game statistics, configure game settings, access Game Center, or view
    support info, the player accesses the game menu by touching the <i>Info</i> icon at the
    top of the playing screen.
